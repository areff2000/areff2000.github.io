<p>
A University of Melbourne training on Plotly.js was held on 22-23 March, 2017.
The focus was on using the Plotly javascript library to enhance research output.
Focus on interactivity, through buttons, rollovers were useful.
Loading csv files were especially important for me. I loaded one of my datasets below.</p>

<p>See DataVis at: <a href="https://areff2000.github.io/plotly_training_Mar2017/plotly_csv.html">https://areff2000.github.io/plotly_training_Mar2017/plotly_csv.html</a>.
</p>

<p>This dataset looks at regional growth of employees, from 2002 to 2014.
Regional growth is shown as a % change over four years.</p>

See a major output below.<br>
Data comes from: Figshare: see <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4056282.v6">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4056282.v6</a>
