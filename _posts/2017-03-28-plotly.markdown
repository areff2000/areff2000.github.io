title: Visualising with Plotly - Where are Australian jobs growing?
layout: post
---
<p>
A University of Melbourne training on Plotly.js was held on 22-23 March, 2017. See summary notes <a href="https://maegul.github.io/DataViz_web_plotly_cheat_sheet/">here - https://maegul.github.io/DataViz_web_plotly_cheat_sheet/</a>.
The focus was on using the Plotly javascript library to enhance research output.
Focus on interactivity, through buttons, rollovers were useful.
Loading csv files were especially important for me. I loaded two of my datasets below.</p>

</ul>
</p>

<p>The 1st dataset compares 4K Hisense TV prices, by size, by retail vs RRP, by model. Data is in Source.</p>
<p>The 2nd dataset looks at World GDP over 2,000 years as a bubble chart
<p>This 3rd dataset looks at regional growth of employees, from 2002 to 2014.
Regional growth is shown as a % change over four years.</p>

See a major output below.<br>
Data comes from: Figshare: see <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4056282.v6">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4056282.v6</a>
